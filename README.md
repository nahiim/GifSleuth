# GifSleuth

A C++ CLI(command-line interface) application that works like a search engine for animated GIFs by pulling the GIFs via GIPHY API and presents the URLs to the user.

Libraries used:
- asio - to connect to the Endpoint.
- nlohmann/json - to parse the json data gotten from the API to extract the URL.
